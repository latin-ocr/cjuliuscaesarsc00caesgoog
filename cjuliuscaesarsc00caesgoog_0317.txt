os the other two, and that oi cesar, by occasionally yieldiug to Pompey's
same, to raise his own, ‘⁶ and crowu his mad ambition.”

From thisperiod the statewas ivholly managed by Caesar; and the vio·
lence olbis proceedlngs rendered the hiamoz'rr' objects os just abhorrence
to all classes os the community. Cicero, to whom Pompey consessed he
hadbeenduped by Oaesar. advised him to break otl'all connection with that
intriguiug and unprincipledpolitician 3 but with him the winning address
ot' Oaesar had more intluence, who not only preserved their former inti·
macy, in opposition to the advice of Cicero, but strengthened their union
by giving Poinpey, in marriage, his daughter J ulia, a woman oi the most
amiable disposition, and ol' the most eugaging manners. So great was
her intluence with both her father and husband, thatin spite oi the mutual
jealousy and aversion which wc‘re afterwards manifested between thern,
she prevented their coming to any rupture as long as she lived. To increase
his power in the state, and to command the interest oi Piso, who succeeded
him in the consulship, he married his daughter Calpurnia. A strong and
respectable party, animated by love of their country, theu began warmiy
to oppose the mensures ol the triumvirate. Caesar, anxious to intimidate
rbem‚bribed Vettius, who had t'ormerly preferred au accusation against
himself, to declam, that he had been urged by some oi the nobles to as·
sassinate Pompey: but this villany, being detected by the people, was
treated with such contempt, that he was glad to drop it; and to prevent
discoveryhe put Vettius to death in prison. Notwithstanding-these acts

. oi enormity, he still retained a very poweriul party in the state. Previ-

ously to the expiration os his consulship, be obtained from the peopls
through his agent, the tribune Vatinius, the province os Gallia Cisalpina
and Illyricum with three legions sor five years; and the senate, nt the
desire oi Caesar, added Gallia Transalpina and another legion. These
legions were gradually increased to thirteen. Some os the succeeding
magistrates wished to annul his acts, and to prosecute him ior his illegal
conduct during his consulship; but having the tribunes in his interest, a
veto was put on all their proceediugs.

Cesar is supposed to have set out t'or Gaul in the end os March, B. G.
58. Oi his conquestos that country, checlring'rhe inroads os the Ger-
mans, and'overrunniuga part os Britain, the Commentaries os the Gallie
War coutain a rapid but well written account. The young reader must
not inter, that all his engagements with these nations are sully recorded,
or that every circumstance oi his conduct with regard to them is either
minutely or faithfully detailed. Respect i'or his character asa man in·
dueed him reconceal many particulare, and to hlnt at rather than describe
others. His cruelty and injusticc in attacking the states in alliance with
Rome, called forth merited reprehension in the senate, where it was even
proposed, that, sorbis abusa of power in that country, he should be given
up to the enemy; but the splendores bis success prevented that motion
from passing into a law.
