308 LITE ΟΡ CAESAR-

crucifixion. diter his return to Βοωε, he was, by the vote of the people, ·
appointed amilitary tribune. He allerwards'obtaiued the officesos quaes·
tor, edile, high-priest, praetor, and consul. During his quaestorship his
wife Cornelia and his aunt J ulia, the widowos Marius, died ς and he
delivered atuueral oration from the rostra in honoros both. He then mar-
ried Pompeia, the daughter os Q. Pompeius, and grand-daughter of Sylla.
To gain the lavor os the people, when an aedile, he surpassed all his pre-
decessors in the extravagante and magnificence ol his shows. To damle
and captivate the multitude, and to wealren the power os the nobles, was
his constant aim. The success ot' hls military enoerprises rendered him
asavorite with the army, and his profuse bribery secured in his interest
the populace os Rome. That his object, from his early years, had been
his own aggrandizement on the tuin os tu's country, is manifest srorn his
having been concerned, first, in the conspiracy of, Crassus and Sylla, and
eilerwards, in that ol Catilina. The judgment which he gave in the sen·
ate, wtih respect to the punishment of Lentulus, Cethegus, cte, accom-
plices os Catilius, the conduct ot' the Roman equites, who guarded the
temple where the senate had met, end his being arraigned asan associate
os that rebel before the quaestor and the senate, sufficiently prove both the
public opinion and his guilt. He lengued with these traitors, not to pro
mote their schemes, but by their means to' destroy the liberties oi' his
. country, and become the unlimited sovereigtt of Rome.

The senate seem to have been apprehensive of the power and indu-
ence oi Caesar by the time he uvas elected consul, which induced them
to decree provinces os little importance to the consuls dorthat year. This

provoked his resentment, and he labored to effect areconciliation between
Pompey and Croesus, which he at last, aiter great exertion,accomplished.
The interest os the former he had keenly supported iu the passing of the
Manilian law, which conterred exnaordinary powers on that commender,

end likewise on other occasions, though not without an ultimate view to
his own advantage. Whatever power, beyond what was usual, had been
assigned to others, served asa precedent for his soliciting the like l'or
himself. With Crassus a man os prodigious wealth‚ but of no great
personal merit, he had long been in habits oi friendship. Of all the aa
man citizens, Pompey possessed the greatest power, Crassus the greatest
riches, and Coesar the greatest abillties ln this coalition, which was in
fact a conspiracy against the liberties os Rome, they solemnly swore that
. nothing was to hedone in the state but by their common consent. The
combination of these three great men was called the first triumphata. ot
the three, Pompey was the least criminal. He appears tohave beenduped
by the insinuating addre'ss os Caesar, in whose consulship he expected to
get his acts in Asia ratified. The decree could only gratisy his vanity‚
which was his ruling passiam but the means, which he employed to accom-
plish it, were highly criminal. The objectos Crassus was to add to his
tvealth, and to increase his influence in the state, hythe power and talents
