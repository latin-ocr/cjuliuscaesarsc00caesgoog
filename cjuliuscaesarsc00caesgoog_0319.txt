gave the kingdom oi Bosphorus, on the sea os Azoph, enti eutrusted
nonnius with the seulement oi other affairs in Asia. To quell the com·
motione ln Italy, he returned to that country, levying great contributione
lot· the African war from the states through which he passed. The good
fortune oi Gaesar did not fail him in this expedition3 he defeated the re-
publican immundissimum nn engagement near Thapsus, and te·
duced the kingdom ol their elly, Juba, iring oi Mauritania, to a Roman
province. On hearing oi casar’s success, Ceto killed himself et illice.
Retnrning to Rome, Caesar, at the interval ola few days, triumphsd four
dilibrent times, in consequence os his haring conqueted Gaul, Egypt,
Pontmaud Africa. ’

The plunderoi so many eountries cnuhled the conqueror ol the world
to glut his soldiers with presente, and the citizens with largesses. To
duale the eyes oi the multitude, and to divert the miris os the citizens from
the extinction oi „their liberties, he exhibited shows ol uncommon mag-

The senate has been blamed sor conferring such extravagant honore,
anti sor bestowing such unlimited power ou Caesam but in this they
merely granted what they had then no power to withhold. They elected

him consul every year, anddiotator for life, appointed him superintendent
ol public morals, and conferred upon 'him the title os imperator end father
oi his country. They decreed himen elevated seat in the theatre, a gold·

their extravaganee and impiety, they voted temples, altars, und priests, to
