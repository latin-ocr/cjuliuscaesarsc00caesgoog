had for some 111110 existed between Caesar aud Pompey, gave place to

friends fled from Italy, and crossed over to Graece. In sixty days, Cesar
conquemd all ltaly, entered Rome, and took possession of the treasury,
which Pompey, by au unaccountable oversight, had 1011 behind him, Hav-
ingseized the public treasure, he leil the command of the army ln Italy to

inhabitants 01 all the towns on his road thither, except the people 01 Mar·
willer, who refrtaed to admit him within their gates. Unwilling to spend
much time in the reductiones that city, he gave the-command of the
troops who were to attach it by land, to Trebonius, his lieutenantgencral,
and 01 dre lieet to Decimus Brutus. Having brought the war ia Spain to
a successful termination, on his return to Rome he compelled the inhab-
