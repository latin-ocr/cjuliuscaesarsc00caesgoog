ination of the magistatew be considered to be put in his power by the
success of his annu hence the coucurrence of the senate in these matters
was deerned unnecessary. It must not be denied that bis conduct, when
supreme commender, was marked with great clemency‚ and that he ea-
actcd several salutary laws for the better regulation of the state. He
administered justice without partiality, and added to the greatness of the
empire by planting Roman colonias beyond scas. But his elevated sta·
tion, as well as the mensures by which it had been obtained, created him
enemies; and the prinoipal senators, among wbom was his most intimate
friend Brutus, conspired against his life. He died in the senate-house, ou
tlre loth of March, 44 Β. O, in the fifty-aiath year of his age, pieta-ed by
twenty-three wouuds, aiter heliud enjoyed the peaoenrl poesession of the
empire only dre months'.

Of Caesar's intrepidlty as a soldier, and abilities ssa commender, the
armies whim he defeated, and the countries which he conquered, arc
sufficicntproofs. To the talenta of aconsummate general, he added those
of an elegant historian and a persnasive orator. Much of his Commen-
taries is said to have been composed on the spot where his battles were
fought. The purity and neatnest of his style, notwithstanding the rapidity
with which he must have written, have not been surpassed hy any Ro·
man writer. His narrative is perspicuous, simple, and natural. lt isat
once chaste aud animated. His lucid aud pictoresque description places
the whole scene distinctly before the render, who accompanies him in all
his marshes, and is a witness of every engagement. F'ew passages oc·
cur in bis iniringa, which the most illiterata do not understand, and the
most polished do not approve. lt would be absurd to expect in the Gom·

mentariesaduishedhistory. They are merc outlincs, which be, perhaps, ’

entertained the hope of seeing filled up, either by himself, or by some
other hand. .

Besides a few juvenile pisces, mentioned by Suetonius, and a collec-
tion of apophthegms, Coesar lest, at his death, two books on grammar, and
a poem which he called Iler, or The Journey. But these, with his let-
ters to the senate and to his friends, arc now lost. Nonc of his writings
now remain, except seven books o'f the Gallio and three of the Giwil war.

Of caesars talents as an orator, we have the opinion of Cicero and
Quintilian. His orations were admired lor two quaiities, not always
united, strength aud elegance. Cicero places him among the first orators,
and Quintilian asserts that he spolie with the same spirit with which he
fought. Had not ambitlou, says that great critic, diverted (iasar from
the arts of peace, he would have rivaled the eloquence of Cicero.
